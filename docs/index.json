[{"content":" I switched to a new team last year October. The last 6 months have been a challenging and tough period in my life, prompting considerable reading and self-reflection. After a very brief period, I was fortunate to continue work on LLM in a new team in Labs with the help of a good friend. Now as things are finally getting back on track, I\u0026rsquo;d like to share some valuable lessons that helped me. If you find yourself sitting in front of the computer, bored enough to open this article, you might find these lessons helpful to you as well.\nEmbrace Longtermism The concept of longtermism embodies various layers of interpretation. In todayâ€™s fast-paced world, where technological advancements progress rapidly, it seems that success stories often revolve around those who capitalize on short-term opportunities to become rich and famous. Pursuing longtermism might appear outdated and irrelevant. However, I maintain that focusing on long-term gains, while disregarding short-term fluctuations, is not only worthwhile but increasingly essential.\nGood capital theory Good capital is ruthless on profit, and patient on scaling.\nI first encoutered this great quote in one of my favorite author Clayton Christensen\u0026rsquo;s book 1. The dichotomy of short term and long term effort, and the dynamic relathionship is greatly summarized in this sentence. Specifically, the longtermism I\u0026rsquo;m referring to is exactly the one mentioned in this quote, where one should identify opportunities which you have great passion (\u0026ldquo;ruthless on profit\u0026rdquo;), and stick to it with great patience.\nI often find myself thinking \u0026ldquo;Auh.. I wish I had spent the last year solidify this skill\u0026rdquo;, whether it be exercising, learning a new language, mathmatic skills or writing. Like many others, I often find myself too eager to reap the benefits before properly sowing the seeds. In reality, life is a marathon. Once you know you are heading towards the right direction, it\u0026rsquo;s crucial to grow the necessary skills before scale it up.\nGrit, your effort counts twice $$ \\text{achivements} = \\text{gift} * \\text{effort}^2 $$\nThis is another great summary I read from the famous book \u0026ldquo;Grit\u0026rdquo;, and also something I deeply felt in my past experience. While I think I\u0026rsquo;m a quick learner that tend to grasp 80% of things in a short amount of time, I some times failed to spend enough efforts to achieve mastery. The key idea encoded in this equation is that, while you can achieve a skill with high gift and low effort. True achievements can only be achieved when you also spend enough time practicing those skills and become an expert.\nI also find this quote optimistic. When you work hard, and much harder than others, the quadratic multiplier will eventually catch up and let you surpass anyone who is either gifted or privileged.\nPatient For those who aim high, It seems many are eager to achieve success quickly. I even have friends who made hundreds of millions of dollars in their mid 20s.\nBut those are indeed exceptionally rare cases. Remember your life is a marathon, and you should measure your life in a span of years. Try to compare to who you were yesterday, reflect, and focus on doing better today. If I could tell myself something 5 years ago, I\u0026rsquo;d say \u0026ldquo;give it more time\u0026rdquo;.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also come to observe that the astonishing achievements don\u0026rsquo;t just appear out of thin air. They are usually the result of years of practice, failure and growth, all accumulating to a significant turning point. Therefore, one should not expect overnight success without years of dedication.\nMoney is only a means to an end In my first few years, I was really desparate to achieve financial security. My mom sold the only appartment to afford my tuition, and the pressure was real that I need to find a way to repay the investment.\nHowever, just a few years after graduation (thanks to Google), I managed to achieve that financial independence. Gradually, I realized that money isn\u0026rsquo;t on top of my list.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t deny that it feels great to get a pay raise, or a huge bonus. But even when I do get money, spending it on others - like host a party with my best friends, buying gifts for my parent - brings me more joy than spending them on myself.\nMy true joy really comes from working on very important things and solving hard challenges whose solutions are beneficial to the society, and with people I deeply love and respect. In that sense, I\u0026rsquo;m very happy right now to tackle some of the hardest problems with my friends in the new Labs team.\nOne last thing\u0026hellip; your action defines your value As the final part, I think it worth talk about the word value.\nOver the past 6 months, I worked in a team where a winning strategy was clear but unsettling: high achievers in this team require aligning with your boss\u0026rsquo;s desire, double down on it and ruthlessly micromanage anyone assigned to the task (Note, you don\u0026rsquo;t have to be technically strong scientifically correct, it\u0026rsquo;s all about people games). In this environment, other values like accountability, transparency, creativity, or even basic respect were disregarded.\nSome of the middle level managers tried to justify their actions by saying \u0026ldquo;oh I\u0026rsquo;m in a tough spot\u0026rdquo;. However, I truly believe it\u0026rsquo;s your action that justify your value, not what you talk about.\nJean-Paul Sartre once said, \u0026ldquo;In fashioning myself I fashion man2\u0026rdquo; suggesting that every choice we make sets a moral standard for others. That applies here, it\u0026rsquo;s true that those middle managers can justify their actions (or inaction) with the pretext that it\u0026rsquo;s just temporary. Yet fundamentally, they chose a path where climbing Google\u0026rsquo;s corporate ladder takes precedence over building an impactful product, or being a good person. Essentially, they chose their values through actions.\nMy takeaway from this experience is that, everyone bears the responsibility to shape the world with their values, and it is your action in daily life does that. It is crucial to act in accordance with your beliefs to lead a coherent life. This, I believe, is an essential expression of a free and independent spirit.\nHow will you measure your life\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis is from Jean-Paul Sartre\u0026rsquo;s famous Existentialism Is a Humanism, in which he expound how your choice defines you. A must read that I highly recommend.\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://realcwl.github.io/posts/lesson_i_learned/","summary":"I switched to a new team last year October.
